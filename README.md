# LangLoc

A demographic mapping tool to find the population of native speakers across the U.S.

## Motivation

I wanted to make an app that would allow users to find the population density of speakers of whatever language across the country, and view it on a map.

2.  Wait for map to populate with markers
3.  Select a location and view popup with number of speakers in that area
